            <h3>Vermont to Colorado</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Growing up in Vermont in the 90's and early 00's was a rare opportunity for a truly magical childhood. In a house on the edge of its Queen City Burlington, with a population of barely 100,000, I was afforded both the sanctuary of the effemoral wilderness just a short walk away, and at the same time was just connected enough to bear witness to the dawn of the internet and our modern era of technology and the Internet of Things. I was deeply in love with the wild places of the world, artistically and creatively engaged in the local musical community, and enthralled with emerging technology.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                It's no wonder that, not long after finishing my undergraduate, I found myself leaving my canoe guiding job in rugged, northern Minnesota for the urban comforts of Denver, Colorado; a place I have called home ever since. Reputed as the "bigger, cooler Vermont", I was in part following my sister who had moved here the summer prior, but also my own sense of adventure in Colorado's vast open wilderness. But more than that, moving to Colorado was also my shot at a career as a classroom educator. See it had come to pass in those wild summer months guiding Boy Scouts through some of the most harrowing adventures of their young lives that I discovered how much I enjoyed teaching and mentoring. When an offer came by to try classroom teaching through the Denver Math Follows program, I of course said yes!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Early Career</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Through the next several years with the Math Fellows and subsequently teaching with the Denver School of Science and Technology charter network, I continued to make meaningful connections and positive impacts in education, but it became apparent that the classroom educator's path was already unsustainable and only becomign more overwhelming, and like many before me decided to leave the profession entirely in 2017.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                For a time I fell back on my passions. I flexed my creative muscles taking a job as a bread baker, and reaquainted myself with the wild places I'd not made time to visit in too many years. And, with time to reflect I came to realize that perhaps, as I had once considered early in my undergraduate career, the path I really wanted to go down was into tech and coding. It was after all an artistic and analytical field, satisfying both my creative tendencies and love of creative problem solving, never mind the breadth and depth of lifelong learning opportunities and a host of other benefits. And so, after whethering the worst of the pandemic, I came into the second career path of my life.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>My Journey In Tech</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                My interest in tech began many decades ago, when I was a freshman in highschool. My friends and I had dscovered the power of DOS commands, and promptly abused that power to start turning off each other's machines while taking computer-based tests or writing long essays. Nefarious, perhaps, but I realized at that moment that, in an internet of things, the only limits to what is truly possible are those of the hardware and of the imagination.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                I had tinkered with technology ever since, from learning some Visual Basic in the 11th grade to teaching Computer Literacy and 3D Printing electives in my educational years. It wasn't until a few years ago that I started my journy into technology as a career. In the final months of 2021, I enrolled in the Backend Engineering program at the <a href="https://turing.edu/">Turing School of Software and Design</a>. This 1500-hour, ACCET-accredited curriculum was a grueling introduction to Object Oriented Programming with Ruby, web-app design in Rails and a special emphasis on REST-ful API design, along with a smattering of other necessary skills like Git workflows and Test Driven Design philosophy.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Upon graduation from Turing, I was thrilled to begin a new role as a Backend Engineer doing Professional Services work at <a href="http://www.form.com">FORM</a>. Here I had the opportunity to build software in a professional services capacity, extending the base functionality of FORM's GoSpotCheck product to meet the specific needs of our clients; everything from asynchronous, automated data pipelines to API integrations, front end work building responsive business reporting dashboards and database-level work building the postgres functions to populate them with real-time data. I gained exposure to and experience with huge codebases, a kubernetes-based microservice deployment architecture, asynchronous task automation, messaging with Kafka, and a whole host of other skills. But perhaps more importantly, I learned how to fulfill the essential role of a backend engineer working on a globally diverse team and collaborating with other engineers and project managers from across the company. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As I set out for my next role, I am excited to have more time to do some self-directed learning for the sake of interest, not just the needs of a project, and I am reminded of the limitless potential of the field that has always kept me engaged with it. I hope you will visit my GitHub page to see what I've been writing, and the portfolio portion of this profile page to see both code repositories and deployed examples of the other projects I'm currently working on!
