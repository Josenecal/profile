            <h3>My Journey In Tech</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                My interest in tech began many decades ago, when I was a freshman in highschool. My friends and I had dscovered the power of DOS commands, and promptly abused that power to start turning off each other's machines while taking computer-based tests or writing long essays. Nefarious, perhaps, but I realized at that moment that, in an internet of things, the only limits to what is truly possible are those of the hardware and of the imagination.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                I had tinkered with technology ever since, from learning some Visual Basic in the 11th grade to teaching Computer Literacy and 3D Printing electives in my educational years. It wasn't until a few years ago that I started my journy into technology as a career. In the final months of 2021, I enrolled in the Backend Engineering program at the <a href="https://turing.edu/">Turing School of Software and Design</a>. This 1500-hour, ACCET-accredited curriculum was a grueling introduction to Object Oriented Programming with Ruby, web-app design in Rails and a special emphasis on REST-ful API design, along with a smattering of other necessary skills like Git workflows and Test Driven Design philosophy.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Upon graduation from Turing, I was thrilled to begin a new role as a Backend Engineer doing Professional Services work at <a href="http://www.form.com">FORM</a>.
